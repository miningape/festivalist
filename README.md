# Git Process
0. Make sure you have the repo on your local system
```bash
git clone <link-to-github-repo>
```
1. Update to latest changes
```bash
git pull
```
2. Update npm, to latest
```bash
npm install 
```
3. Make changes to files and stuff ;)
4. Stage git (<filename> can be . to include the whole directory)
```bash
git add .
```
5. Commit changes (make a good change message/maybe even a change doc)
```bash
git commit -m 'write what you did here'
```
6. Finally push those changes (if we use branches this might be different) 
```bash
git push
```
